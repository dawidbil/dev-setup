### Installation

Seems like ubuntu repository holds old version of i3 (4.17 whereas i3 documentation mentions 4.21), probably a good idea to add their repository.

https://i3wm.org/docs/repositories.html

### i3 configuration

Located inside `~/.i3/config.d/` folder (files ending with `.conf` extension). The last line at `~/.i3/config` includes those configuration files.

### Touchpad extra gestures
