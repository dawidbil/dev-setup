### Installation

Seems like ubuntu repository holds old version of i3 (4.17 whereas i3 documentation mentions 4.21), probably a good idea to add their repository.

https://i3wm.org/docs/repositories.html

### i3 configuration

Located inside `~/.i3/config.d/` folder (files ending with `.conf` extension). The last line at `~/.i3/config` includes those configuration files.

### Policy Kit

You need to install one of the polkits to have an authentication agent.

https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Polkit

In this case install `policykit-1-gnome`, as agent from this package will be launched by `polkit.conf` configuration file.

### Brightness

Install `brightnessctl` to make bindings in `brigthness.conf` file working.
